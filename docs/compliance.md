# Compliance and the audit trail

This page maps CertMate's audit trail to the regimes operators most often ask
about — the EU AI Act, NIS2, and ISO/IEC 42001 — when they let an AI/MCP agent
operate certificates on a schedule.

> **Read this first.** CertMate is a single-instance, self-hosted MIT tool. It is
> **not** an AI system, **not** a high-risk AI system, and **not** a regulated
> entity, and it does not "comply with" or "certify" anything. Compliance
> obligations fall on the **operator** running it. What CertMate provides is
> **evidence artifacts** an operator can use toward *their own* obligations.
> Every claim below is "enables the operator to evidence X", with the limits
> stated explicitly.

## What the audit trail provides today

- **Attribution.** Every certificate-lifecycle action — create, renew, reissue,
  deploy, auto-renew toggle, and unattended scheduled renewals — is recorded
  with a structured `actor` (human vs API token vs AI agent, down to the API key
  id) and `trigger` (manual, API, agent, or the scheduler job). An AI agent's
  actions are distinguishable from a human's, provided the agent uses an
  `is_agent`-flagged key. See [API: Audit Logging](./api.md#audit-logging) and
  the [MCP guide](./mcp.md#audit-attribution).
- **Tamper-evidence.** Entries are written into an append-only SHA-256 hash
  chain (`data/audit/certificate_audit.chain.jsonl`). Any modification,
  deletion, or reorder by someone who cannot recompute the chain is detectable
  and localizable.
- **Independent verification.** A standalone verifier
  (`python -m modules.core.audit_verify`) recomputes the chain and returns
  PASS/FAIL without needing to run or trust CertMate; `GET /api/audit/verify`
  exposes the same check over the API and, when signing is enabled, also
  cross-checks the chain against the latest signed checkpoint — so a tail
  truncation or rewrite at or below that checkpoint fails verification (see
  "tail truncation" under Honest limits).
- **Signed, third-party-verifiable export.** The instance signs the chain head
  (periodic checkpoints) and `GET /api/audit/export` produces an Ed25519-signed
  bundle. An auditor verifies it off the box, pinning the instance's public key
  (`GET /api/audit/public-key`) out of band — proving both that the record was
  written, not edited, and which instance produced it. That endpoint returns
  JSON, not a PEM file: save its `public_key_pem` field as the `.pem` the
  verifier's `--pubkey` expects. It answers 404 when the instance has no
  signing key.
- **SIEM audit sink (push).** Each audit entry can also be streamed live to an
  external collector in a standard format — **syslog** (RFC 5424) or **CEF**
  over UDP/TCP, or **generic HTTP/JSON** — configured under `audit_sink` in
  settings. Entries pass through the credential/secret sanitizer before they
  leave the process (a token in a detail field is redacted), and the sink is
  failure-isolated with a short timeout, like the hash chain: a dead collector
  never blocks or breaks a certificate operation. Lifecycle coverage includes
  create / renew / deploy / revoke, and the scheduled summary digest: it is an
  audit entry, so it reaches the sink like any other. What it records is the
  outcome, how many recipients it was for, and the counts it reported — **not
  the recipients themselves**, who are personal data this chain cannot take
  back out afterwards. A digest skipped because notifications or SMTP are off
  writes nothing: the settings answer that, and a weekly entry saying so would
  grow the chain forever to say nothing.

## Regime mapping

### NIS2 (Directive (EU) 2022/2555) — the strongest fit

- **What it helps with.** Certificate operations change the trust posture of
  services, so they are security-relevant events. CertMate produces a
  tamper-evident, attributed, time-stamped record of every such operation, plus
  an independently verifiable check — usable as part of the operator's logging
  (Art. 21) and incident-evidence (Art. 23) practices.
- **Limit.** NIS2 binds essential/important **entities**, not software tools.
  CertMate supplies logs and a verifier the operator can use; it does not assess,
  monitor, or report incidents, and being an in-scope entity (and meeting NIS2 in
  full) is the operator's responsibility.

### EU AI Act — Article 50 transparency (spirit only; the weakest fit)

- **What it helps with.** When an AI agent autonomously operates PKI, the record
  carries an explicit `actor.kind="agent"` marker plus the agent session, so the
  operator can demonstrate after the fact which changes were made by an AI agent
  versus a human, under which identity, and what triggered them — supporting the
  transparency and human-oversight spirit of the Act.
- **Limit.** Art. 50 duties fall on **providers/deployers of AI systems** and
  concern disclosure to natural persons interacting with AI. An agent renewing
  TLS certificates is not a textbook Art. 50 case, and CertMate is a tool, not an
  AI system. We map to the transparency spirit only; CertMate does **not** satisfy
  Art. 50 on anyone's behalf.

### ISO/IEC 42001 (AI management system) — operational records

- **What it helps with.** The attributed, tamper-evident records are objective
  evidence that an AI agent took specific certificate actions — usable for the
  operational-records and traceability controls of the operator's own AIMS.
- **Limit.** ISO 42001 certifies an organisation's management system, not a tool.
  CertMate is not certified to ISO 42001 and cannot certify the operator; it
  produces records the operator can present as evidence for their own controls.

## Honest limits (do not over-read these)

- **The signing key does not bind the operator.** A signed export bundle (and
  the periodic signed checkpoints) let a third party verify, off the box, which
  instance produced the record and that it was not edited — for anyone who does
  **not** hold the signing key. But the operator holds the key and could re-sign
  a rewritten chain. Fully constraining the operator requires shipping the signed
  checkpoints to an external append-only sink (**opt-in external anchoring — a
  planned follow-up, not yet shipped**). Treat the current guarantee as
  "authenticity, ordering, and instance attribution of the recorded entries",
  independently verifiable by a third party who holds an exported, signed copy.
- **Authenticity, not completeness.** Audit writes are best-effort and never
  block a certificate operation; the chain proves the recorded entries are
  authentic and ordered, and a missing interior `seq` proves a deletion, but a
  write that failed before it was recorded leaves no entry to verify.
- **Tail truncation is caught down to the last signed checkpoint.** Removing
  entries from the **end** of the chain leaves a shorter-but-internally-
  consistent chain. `GET /api/audit/verify` now cross-checks the chain against
  the newest signed checkpoint that verifies under the instance key, so any
  truncation, rewind, or rewrite **at or below** that checkpoint fails
  verification — the previously write-only checkpoints are now read back. The
  tail is **sealed on a clean shutdown**: whatever was written since the last
  checkpoint is signed on the way out, so a container that stops normally
  leaves nothing unattested. Two gaps remain: (a) a **crash**, a `SIGKILL` or a
  power loss stops before that, and the entries since the last checkpoint can
  then still be dropped undetected until the next one seals them — narrowed
  from "every stop" to "an unclean stop", not closed; and (b) an operator who
  holds the signing key can re-sign a fresh checkpoint over a rewritten chain.
  Keep successive signed exports, or wait for opt-in external anchoring, if you
  need to close those.
- **The agent-session header is a claim.** It is recorded for correlation but is
  client-supplied; the trustworthy identity is the authenticated API key.
- **Bootstrap actions are attributed to `setup_user`.** Until setup is complete
  an instance serves every request as admin, so there is no real identity to
  record and the chain says so plainly. An entry such as `create` / `user` /
  `setup_user` means that user was created while anyone who could reach the
  instance was an admin. On a current version only the first admin can be
  created that way — a second user or an API key is refused — so exactly one
  such entry is expected. More than one means the instance was bootstrapped
  under an older version, and every user beyond the first is worth confirming
  or removing. API keys minted in that window are badged in the API Keys page
  and wait for an operator; users are not badged, and the chain is where the
  answer for them lives.
- **History boundary.** The chain starts when the feature is first enabled;
  earlier `.log` history is not part of the verifiable chain.
- **A pruned chain proves less, and says so.** If you have run
  `audit_prune` (below), verification covers the entries from the anchor
  forward. The archived prefix is attested by the signed anchor and by the
  exported bundle you hold off the box — not by the chain file. `verify` reports
  `anchored` and the anchor seq for exactly this reason; treat a bare "intact"
  claim about a pruned instance as an overstatement.

## Retention: archiving part of the chain

The chain grows by one line per audited operation — of the order of hundreds of
kilobytes per year on a busy instance — so most operators never need this. It
exists for the case where a retention policy requires older records to leave the
machine.

There is no automatic pruning, and there is no API endpoint for it. Deleting
audit history is exactly what someone who has just compromised an administrator
account would want to do, and an operator with a legitimate retention obligation
has shell access anyway — they have to put the archive somewhere. So it is one
explicit command, run with CertMate stopped:

```bash
# 1. Export the prefix you intend to archive (admin token).
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     "https://certmate.example.com/api/audit/export?to_seq=1199" > archive-0-1199.json

# 2. Verify it OFF this box, pinning the instance key.
python -m modules.core.audit_verify --bundle archive-0-1199.json --pubkey instance.pem

# 3. Store it wherever your policy says. Then, with CertMate stopped:
python -m modules.core.audit_prune --bundle archive-0-1199.json --data-dir data/audit
python -m modules.core.audit_prune --bundle archive-0-1199.json --data-dir data/audit --yes
```

The command without `--yes` is a dry run. It refuses, and removes nothing, if
the bundle does not verify, is unsigned, is empty, is not a prefix of *this*
chain, or disagrees with the chain at any seq, or if pruning would leave the
chain with no entries after the archived prefix — you never delete records
whose only remaining copy is unverified, and you never end up with a chain that
has nothing left to verify.

It also refuses if `--key-dir` holds no signing key, or holds one belonging to
a different instance than the one that exported the bundle. Both are checked
**before** anything is removed: an anchor signed by the wrong key is one the
instance's own `verify` rejects, and discovering that after the records are
gone is too late to be useful.

Point `--key-dir` at the instance's key. It defaults to `data` (relative to the
directory you run the command from) and must hold the instance's
`.audit_signing_key`, unless `AUDIT_SIGNING_KEY_FILE` is set the same way the
instance sets it. The tool never creates a key here: a new key would be a new
instance identity, not this instance's.

What it then does is the part that matters for compliance:

- **The deletion is recorded in the chain that survives it.** An `archive` entry
  is appended naming the seq range, the number of entries, their head hash and
  the SHA-256 of the archive file. A reader of the pruned chain can see that
  entries were removed, when, and which archive holds them.
- **The remainder verifies from a signed anchor.** `certificate_audit.anchor.json`
  states where the chain now starts and what it continues from, signed with the
  instance key, so a chain that was simply truncated cannot be passed off as a
  pruned one — the anchor cannot be forged without the key.
- **It stays honest afterwards.** Verification of a pruned chain never reports a
  plain "intact": both the API and the standalone verifier say which seq the
  guarantee starts at.

Two limits worth stating. The anchor describes the **most recent** archive; the
complete history is the sequence of exported bundles, which is why they must be
kept and why each one's digest is recorded in the chain. And, as everywhere else
on this page, the instance key does not bind the operator: someone holding it can
sign an anchor over a chain they rewrote. Prune only as far back as your archives
genuinely reach.

Signed exports that an external auditor pins to a published key are available
today. If your obligations require binding the operator *themselves* — so that
even the key-holder cannot rewrite history undetected — that needs opt-in
external anchoring of the signed checkpoints to an append-only sink off the box,
which is planned but not yet shipped. Track it before relying on it.
