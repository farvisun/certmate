"""
Regression test for the metadata read-modify-write race in
CertificateManager.record_backend_deployment_status /
record_browser_deployment_status.

Both methods previously did `_load_metadata` -> mutate -> `_save_metadata`
without holding the per-domain lock that already existed in the class.
Two concurrent HTTP requests (one writing the `backend` block, one writing
the `browser` block) could each load `{}`, set their key, and save —
losing whichever update was persisted second.

The fix wraps the RMW in `with self._get_domain_lock(domain):`. This test
pins that contract: after many concurrent updates, both `backend` and
`browser` keys must be present in the persisted metadata.json.
