"""Two files hold a domain's DNS provider, and they must never disagree.

`metadata.json` is what issuance reads. The domain's entry in `settings.json`
is what `get_domain_dns_provider` reads. Both are authoritative, and they were
updated by **two separate writes with the domain lock released between them**:
`CertificateService.update_config` wrote the metadata under the lock and
returned, and the route wrote the settings entry afterwards.

Nothing reconciled them. A renewal starting in that window read the **old**
provider from settings while the metadata already said the new one — and
neither file was wrong on its own, which is what makes it hard to see.

Both writes now happen inside the same `domain_lock` section, so the pair is
atomic with respect to a renewal.

**Lock ordering was checked before doing this**, because taking the settings
lock while holding the domain lock creates one. No settings mutate callback
anywhere in the codebase acquires a domain lock, so the reverse order does not
exist and this cannot deadlock. Anything that adds one would have to take the
domain lock first — which is why it is stated in the code and here.
