"""`requests-mock` in the production image is upstream's choice, not ours —
and this watches for the day that stops being true.

A test-shaped library in a production image is a real smell, and the obvious
reaction is to delete the line from requirements.txt. That would not remove the
package: three certbot DNS plugins declare `requests-mock` as an unconditional
runtime requirement, so pip installs it regardless. Deleting the line would only
un-pin it, leaving the shipped version to whichever floating lower bound a
plugin happens to carry — strictly worse than choosing it ourselves.

So the pin stays, and the justification beside it has to remain true. This
checks both directions (#660):

* the claim is still accurate — something really does require it at runtime;
* and when nothing does any more, this fails and says the line can go, instead
  of the pin outliving its reason the way stale rationale usually does.
