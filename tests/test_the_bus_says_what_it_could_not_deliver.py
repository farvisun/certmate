"""What the event bus could not dispatch is drained, counted and named.

The dispatch workers are daemon threads on purpose: joining them would let a
300-second deploy hook hold shutdown open until the container runtime killed it
anyway, and that trade is written into the bus. The cost of it was invisible.
A container stopped during or just after a renewal sweep discarded whatever was
still queued — typically the deploy hook for a certificate that HAD been
renewed — so the service kept serving the old certificate, the dashboard showed
a success, `deploy_hook_failed` never fired (the hook had not failed, it had
never started), and nothing anywhere recorded it. The bus had no stop, drain,
close or join at all.

`stop()` does not change the daemon decision. It bounds the loss and names it:
queued work gets a deadline to start, and what is left is taken off the queue
and logged with its event and its domain, so an operator reading the log after
a restart knows which certificates to redeploy by hand.

The property that matters is the count and the naming, not the timing, so that
is what these assert.
