"""Every endpoint the product advertises must be a route the app serves.

`GET /{domain}/tls` was in the README's feature list, in the README's
"Automation-Friendly Download URL" section with a worked example, and in the
in-product help page — as a listed endpoint *and* as the copy-pasteable curl
command underneath it. It returns 404. There are 130 routes in the app and not
one of them contains `/tls`; the real endpoints are
`/api/certificates/<domain>/download` and `.../download/<file_type>`.

Nothing caught it because the documentation was checked against itself. The
route table is the only thing that knows what exists, so the check below asks
the application, not a list someone maintains by hand.
