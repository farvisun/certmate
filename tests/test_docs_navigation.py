"""Guard: every documentation page must be reachable, in every language.

A page nobody links to is a page nobody reads. `docs/mcp.md` had existed in
all five languages for months — a full reference for the MCP server, sixteen
tools, the agent-attribution model — and no `index.md` in any language linked
to it, so the only way to find it was to already know it was there. The same
was true of `compliance.md`, `deploy-hooks.md` and `probes*.md`.

The README's own "Complete Documentation Set" table was missing six of the
thirteen pages, which is a specific kind of wrong: a table that claims to be
complete and is not.

    Every arrow in the high-level diagram points down: web and API call into

    `modules.web` in order to register them, which is `core/` reaching upward.

    That is what a composition root is for, and the diagram says so. If a
