# Fixed fixtures, not values recomputed with hashlib at test time.
#
# Recomputing them would mean the test derives the expected hash with the same
# algorithm the implementation uses, so a shared mistake would cancel out and
# the test would still pass. These are literal captures of the two pre-bcrypt
# formats for the password "pw", which is what an old settings.json actually
# contains.
#
# It also keeps `hashlib.sha256(<a password>)` out of the repository, which
# CodeQL flags as py/weak-sensitive-data-hashing — correctly, and unhelpfully,
# since constructing a weak hash is the only way to prove one gets replaced.
