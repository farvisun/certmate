"""Guard: no two requirements may install the same import path.

pip has no opinion about two distributions that ship the same top-level
package. It installs both, one over the other, and reports success. The
version pin on the loser is then decorative — and nothing in CI notices,
because every test still passes against whichever copy happened to win.

That is exactly what `certbot-dns-hetzner==3.0.0` did: it depends on
`dns-lexicon-coop`, a third-party fork of `dns-lexicon` that ships an
identical `lexicon/` package. Both were resolved into the default image, so
`dns-lexicon==3.25.1` in requirements.txt could be silently replaced by the
fork's 3.24.3, and `modules/core/dns_alias_hook.py` — which imports
`lexicon.client` for alias mode across fourteen providers — ran whichever one
landed last.

These tests are cheap and offline: they read requirements files and the
installed metadata, and never touch the network.
