"""The Python version the documentation names must be one that can install this.

Every surface said **Python 3.9+** — the README badge, the README requirements
list, the architecture guide in five languages, the installation guide in five
languages — while `requirements.txt` cannot be installed on 3.9 at all. Not
"is untested on": cannot be installed. Six pinned packages declare
`Requires-Python >=3.10`, so pip refuses before it downloads anything:

    $ python3.9 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
    ERROR: Ignored the following versions that require a different python
    version: ... 1.0.5 Requires-Python >=3.10 ...
    ERROR: No matching distribution found for certbot-dns-hetzner-cloud==1.0.5

    $ python3.9 -m pip install -r requirements-minimal.txt
    ERROR: No matching distribution found for dns-lexicon==3.25.1

Measured on 3.9.6, not inferred from metadata. So the very first command a
source installer runs failed, on the version the badge at the top of the README
told them to use, and `docs/testing.md` claimed CI covered 3.9 and 3.11 while
the matrix has only ever held one entry.

The floor and the tested version are two different questions, and the honest
answer to both is the same number today: the image is built `FROM python:3.12`
and the matrix is `['3.12']`. So the rule is that documentation names the
version we actually build and test — not a floor nobody exercises.
