"""A password longer than 72 bytes must keep working across the bcrypt 5 upgrade.

bcrypt has always ignored everything past the 72nd byte. Up to 4.x it truncated
silently; **5.0.0 raises `ValueError` instead**, and that turns a working login
into a permanent, silent lockout:

  * the stored hash was derived from the truncated form and is still valid;
  * `_verify_password` catches `ValueError` and returns `False`, so the operator
    is told their password is wrong — for ever, with nothing in the logs;
  * `_hash_password` has no such catch, so *setting* a long password would have
    raised out of the request instead.

Neither is hypothetical. Measured before the bump was taken:

    >>> h = bcrypt.hashpw(("a"*100).encode()[:72], bcrypt.gensalt())   # 4.x
    >>> bcrypt.checkpw(("a"*100).encode(), h)                          # 5.0.0
    ValueError: password cannot be longer than 72 bytes

So the truncation is explicit on both sides now, which preserves 4.x behaviour
exactly rather than changing it during a dependency upgrade. These tests are
what keep it that way.
