"""
Regression test for renewal job N+1 settings reads.

The settings request-scoped cache (commit f0b77c3) only fires inside a
Flask request context. APScheduler's renewal job runs in a background
thread with no request context, so before this fix every domain in
`check_renewals` triggered a full settings.json reload via
get_certificate_info -> _parse_certificate_info. 1000 domains = 1001
reads of the same file in a single hourly tick.

The fix threads the once-loaded settings dict through
get_certificate_info(settings=...) and _parse_certificate_info(settings=...).
Both methods fall back to load_settings() when settings is None so
existing call sites keep working unchanged.

This test pins:
- check_renewals reads settings exactly ONCE regardless of domain count
- the optional `settings` parameter is honoured (not silently ignored)
- existing single-call sites that pass no settings still trigger a load
