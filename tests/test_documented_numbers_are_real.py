"""Numbers and names the documentation states, checked against their source.

Three separate claims, one shape: a value written down once and never compared
with the thing it describes.

  * **The coverage floor.** `docs/testing.md` was corrected to say CI enforces
    65% (`--cov-fail-under=65`). All four translations still promised "80%
    overall, 95%+ on critical paths" — numbers no gate has ever enforced.
    codecov.yml marks both its statuses `informational: true` in as many words.
    The English page being right is exactly what stopped anyone noticing.

  * **Two environment variables in a compose example.** `GUNICORN_WORKERS=1`
    and `GUNICORN_THREADS=8`, in the production docker-compose block. The image
    hardcodes `--workers 1 --threads 8`; neither name is read anywhere in the
    repository. An operator tuning them saw no change and no error.

  * **A Docker Hub link to an image nobody publishes.** `certmate/certmate`,
    once, among twenty correct `fabriziosalmi/certmate` references.

Each check reads the source of truth rather than a second copy of the claim.
