"""A metadata write that does not happen has to say why it did not happen.

Reported as #757: configuring a deployment probe failed with

    Failed: Failed to update metadata for domain: *.xx.xx

and nothing else. The reporter, reasonably, concluded from the message that
wildcards were the problem, and looked at the domain field — which is a text
input with a `<datalist>`, not the dropdown its neighbour is — and concluded
that too. Neither was the cause.

`_save_metadata` returned a bare `False`. Two unrelated situations produced it:

- the file could not be written (a read-only volume, or a certificates
  directory owned by a different uid — the reporter runs on Kubernetes);
- the write was **refused by design**, because `metadata.json` on disk
  declares a newer schema than this build understands and overwriting it
  would drop the fields it cannot read, including which private key belongs
  to the certificate.

Both reasons were computed, written to the server log, and then thrown away
before reaching the person who had to act on one of them. Reproduced against
the running application, both returned the identical body and status:

    {"error": "Failed to update metadata for domain: X"}   HTTP 500

`write_metadata` raises instead, carrying the reason. `_save_metadata` stays
as the boolean wrapper for the six call sites that write metadata during
issuance and renewal and cannot act on a reason — a cosmetic metadata problem
must not become a failed issuance, which is why the split exists at all
rather than the whole thing being changed to raise.
