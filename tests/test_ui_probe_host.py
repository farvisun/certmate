"""A wildcard's probe host must be settable from the UI (#635).

Reported by a user: a wildcard certificate reports "cannot be verified", and the
only way to fix it was `PATCH /api/certificates/<domain>` with a
`deployment_host`. "It would be useful to be able to set the host through the
GUI rather than the API."

Settings → Probe already existed and already wrote `deployment_port` and
`deployment_protocol` through that same PATCH — it simply had no field for the
one value a wildcard actually needs. So this adds the field rather than a new
dialog.

Three things are worth pinning beyond "the input exists", and none of them is
visible from the JS source:

* the value reaches the PATCH body, not just the DOM;
* a certificate configured with ONLY a host counts as configured, or it stays in
  the "Add" list forever and the operator sets it twice;
* clearing the field clears the stored host, so a wrong host can be undone
  without deleting and recreating the probe.
