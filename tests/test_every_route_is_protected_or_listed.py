"""Every route is authenticated, or is on this list with the reason it is not.

Route protection here is expressed three ways, and all three are legitimate:

* the `require_role` / `require_auth` decorators, and `require_web_auth` for
  HTML pages;
* an inline check inside the view — `/` reads the session cookie itself so the
  context processor sees the user. `/api/events/stream` used to be the second
  such route; it now carries `require_session_role('viewer')`, which is that
  same rule expressed once, so it appears in the protected set rather than in
  the list below;
* a redirect to a route that is itself checked — `/audit` redirects to
  `/activity`, `/certificates` to `/`.

What was missing is the *census*. Nothing enumerated the URL map, so a route
added without any check looked exactly like the ones that are public on
purpose: an absence, indistinguishable from every other absence. On a product
that holds private keys, "we think they are all covered" is not a control.

This file is the control. It walks `app.url_map`, reads the protection off each
view — including flask-restx resources, where the guard sits on the Resource
class rather than on the registered view function — and fails when a route is
neither protected nor named below with a reason.

Measured when this was written: **134 rules over 125 distinct paths, 99
protected and 26 public.** The audit finding that prompted this said eighteen
were public; the number was never checked, because nothing could check it.

Adding a route to PUBLIC_ROUTES is the reviewable act. It should be as hard to
do quietly as adding one to the codebase, and the reason has to be one someone
can disagree with in review.
