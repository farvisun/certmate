"""A gauge that is always zero is not a metric, it is a promise nobody keeps.

`certmate_certificates_by_status` was exported with five labels and the
collector assigned four. Every scrape, for every deployment, carried

    certmate_certificates_by_status{status="renewal_failed"} 0

An operator building a dashboard finds that series, writes
`certmate_certificates_by_status{status="renewal_failed"} > 0`, and has an
alert that can never fire — which reads, for as long as nobody checks, as "no
renewal has ever failed here". That is worse than the series not existing: an
absent series makes the rule visibly broken, or is caught by `absent()`.

It could not be assigned either, and that is the substance rather than an
oversight: it is not a state a certificate is IN. A certificate whose renewal
failed is still valid, or expiring soon, or expired — the other four partition
the set, and this one overlaps all of them. The failure is an EVENT, and it is
already counted as one:

    certmate_certificate_renewals_total{status="failure"}

which `_record_renewal_metrics` increments from the renewal sweep and which the
shipped `CertMateRenewalsFailing` rule alerts on with `increase(...)` over 6h —
what matters being that renewals are failing now, not that one ever did.

So the label is removed. This file pins both halves: it is gone, and what it
was meant to tell you is somewhere real.
