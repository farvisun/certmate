"""
Cross-validation tests that pin the contract between independent wiring
points for DNS providers.

Adding a new provider means touching at least: dns_strategies factory,
utils._DNS_PROVIDER_CREDENTIALS, settings.save_settings supported set,
settings propagation defaults, settings multi-account migration map.

It is easy to miss one — issue #99 is exactly this: edgedns shipped
with a working strategy and UI but no entry in the supported_providers
set, so save_settings() rejected the configuration with
"Invalid dns_provider: edgedns".

These tests assert the wiring sets stay in sync. When you add a new
provider, the test breaks until every wiring point is updated.
