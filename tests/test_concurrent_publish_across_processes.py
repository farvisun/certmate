"""Two processes publishing the same domain must not leave a mixed generation.

The per-domain lock is a `threading.Lock` (certificates.py), so it serialises
threads inside one worker and nothing else. The renewal flock covers the
scheduled sweep, and by its own docstring does not cover the synchronous
issuance path. Every existing concurrency test races threads in one
interpreter, so the cross-process case — two containers on a shared data
directory, or an operator who raised `--workers` — was never exercised.

The invariant that has to survive it is not "one of them wins". It is that
whichever wins, the four published PEM files come from the SAME issuance: a
cert.pem from one generation beside a privkey.pem from another cannot complete
a handshake, and it is served straight off disk by the download endpoint and
pushed to every deploy hook.

The promote step is four independent renames, and the staging files are named
after the destination — so both processes stage through the same paths (#663).
