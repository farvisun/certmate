"""Static guards for three frontend defects that a green CI could not see.

These are source-level assertions in the style of tests/test_static_csp.py.
The behaviours they protect are only fully exercised by the Playwright suite
(which needs a running container), but each defect below was a *missing line*
rather than a subtle interaction — a missing listener, a missing fallback, a
missing guard — so pinning the line is what actually stops the regression.

- #424 the SSO tab rendered the blank default form when its GET failed, and
  Save then wrote those defaults over a working configuration.
- #425 the command palette navigated to '/settings#<tab>' by assigning
  location.href; a fragment-only change does not reload, and the pages read
  location.hash exactly once, so choosing a tab you were already on did
  nothing at all.
- #427 the one-time API-key token was copied with navigator.clipboard only,
  which is undefined over plain HTTP — a silent no-op on a token shown once.
