"""Thread count must be a property of the process, not of event volume.

Every `publish()` started one new thread per registered listener — no pool, no
queue, no ceiling. So a renewal sweep across many domains, each publishing to
several listeners, decided how many threads the process had. Nothing in
CertMate chose that number, and nothing reported it.

The replacement is a fixed set of daemon workers reading one queue. Three
properties were chosen deliberately, and each one is a test below because each
could reasonably have gone the other way:

**The publisher never blocks.** It is a request thread on the issuance path and
the scheduler on the renewal path. `DeployManager.on_certificate_event` runs
deploy hooks, each up to a 300-second timeout — putting that on the publisher's
thread would trade a thread problem for a latency problem on the product's main
job.

**Nothing is dropped.** The SSE path drops the oldest message and then the
subscriber, which is right for a browser that fell behind and wrong for a
deploy that has to happen. Certificate events are rare and each matters, so the
backlog is unbounded in length and bounded in cost — one small tuple per
queued call.

**The backlog is visible.** An instance past its capacity says so, once, rather
than being inferred from latency.

The workers stay daemon, as the per-event threads were. A `ThreadPoolExecutor`
would have been fewer lines, but its threads are joined at interpreter exit,
which would let a 300-second deploy hook hold up shutdown until the container
runtime SIGKILLs it anyway.

    """The finding, measured — and measured WHILE the work is outstanding.

    The first version of this test counted threads after the events had been
    delivered. Under the old thread-per-event dispatch that passes: the
    threads finish as fast as they are created and the count is back to
    baseline by the time anything looks. Mutating the code back to
    `threading.Thread(...).start()` did not fail it, which is how the
    measurement was found to be wrong rather than the code right.

    Holding every listener open makes the peak observable, which is the number
    the finding is actually about.

    The counter was wrong too, and in a way that only showed under load
    (#905). `threading.active_count()` is process-global: any other test that
    started or stopped a thread between the baseline and the measurement
    landed in the delta, so the number was about the whole process. Measured:
    three unrelated threads alive in the window pushed a correct bus from 4 to
    7, over a ceiling of 5 — a red on code that is right, which is the worst
    way for a test about concurrency to be wrong.

    Counting the threads that actually RUN the listener answers the same
    question and cannot be polluted: a thread-per-event dispatch delivers 200
    events on 200 distinct threads whatever else the process is doing.
