"""The domain used on the create path is always a bare hostname.

`validate_domain` returns the normalised name as its second value (URL netloc
extracted, lowercased). The create path used to check only the boolean and
keep the caller's raw string, so a value that validated but was not a bare
hostname could reach path construction — `cert_dir / domain`, the certbot
--cert-name, and the per-domain lock key — carrying characters it should not.

Two layers are pinned here:
  * the sources (prepare_create, the batch route) rebind to the normalised
    name, so a URL form becomes a bare hostname;
  * create_certificate itself rejects any domain carrying '/', '\\', '..' or a
    NUL before it builds a path or takes the per-domain lock — the last line
    every caller crosses, including the batch route, which does not go through
    prepare_create.
