"""`metadata.json` must survive a power loss, not just a concurrent reader.

`_atomic_json_write` wrote a temp file and renamed it, and its docstring said
the mechanism existed "to avoid partial writes on crash". The rename gives
*atomicity* — a reader sees the old file or the new one — and says nothing
about crash safety: neither the temp file's contents nor the rename itself had
been pushed out of the page cache, so a power loss between the write and the
data reaching the platter can be replayed as a rename onto an empty or
truncated file.

That file is not incidental. It records key custody: `private_key_state` (the
`external` value that tells the renewal path a CSR-only certificate has no key
here and must not be reissued nightly), the CSR fingerprint, and the CA the
certificate came from — the value without which a private-CA certificate cannot
renew at all. Losing it does not lose a certificate; it loses the instance's
knowledge of what that certificate is.

Three syncs, three different losses, and the tests below pin each one
separately because dropping any of them still passes a naive "the file has the
right contents" assertion:

* `flush()`      — bytes leave Python's buffer
* `fsync(file)`  — bytes leave the kernel's page cache: the CONTENTS survive
* `fsync(dir)`   — the rename is persisted: the NAME survives

The same recipe `modules/core/file_operations.py` already uses for
settings.json, which is why the file that records key custody should not have
had a weaker one.
