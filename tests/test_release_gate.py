"""Guards on the gate that decides whether a release needs a real certificate.

`scripts/release.sh` runs an end-to-end issuance against Let's Encrypt staging
before cutting a release. `SENSITIVE_RE` decides whether that run is MANDATORY
— i.e. whether `--skip-real-cert` is refused. It is the safety catch on the
escape hatch, and until 2026-08-08 it had a hole big enough to drive the whole
DNS subsystem through:

    modules/(core/(certificate|client_cert|deployer|acme|storage)|dns|...)
                                                                 ^^^
`modules/dns` matches nothing. There is no such directory — the DNS code lives
at `modules/core/dns_*.py`. So a change to `dns_providers.py`,
`dns_strategies.py`, `dns_alias_hook.py` or `dns_zone_discovery.py` did not make
the real certificate mandatory, in the gate written *because* two DNS providers
had each shipped never having worked in any release. Sixteen issuance-critical
files were uncovered in all, `modules/core/shell.py` — how certbot is invoked —
among them.

Nobody spotted it because nobody reads a regex that long closely enough. So the
tests below check two different things:

  * the specific files that must be covered, and
  * that **every branch of the pattern matches something real**, which is the
    check that would have caught a dead `modules/dns` on the day it was written.
