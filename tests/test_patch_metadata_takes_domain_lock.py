"""PATCH config must serialise against an in-flight renewal via the per-domain lock.

The PATCH handler did a metadata.json read-modify-write with no lock, while
renew_certificate reads metadata at the start of its certbot run and writes that
pre-renewal snapshot back at the end (holding the per-domain lock the whole
time). A PATCH landing in that window was silently reverted: settings.json got
the new dns_provider (its settings write is locked) while metadata.json — which
renew resolves the provider from — kept the old one, so every later renewal used
the decommissioned credential.

The metadata read-modify-write now runs under certificate_manager.domain_lock,
the same lock create/renew hold, so PATCH either waits for issuance to finish or
returns 409 — never interleaves.
