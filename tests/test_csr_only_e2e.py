"""Real-CA proof that a CSR-only certificate works end to end (#599).

The unit tests pin the decisions; this pins the thing they cannot: that a CSR
generated outside CertMate, submitted over the API, produces a real certificate
from a real ACME server — and that the private key never lands on this node.

Issues against Let's Encrypt STAGING through Cloudflare DNS-01, like the other
real-cert tests. Cert burn: 2 staging certificates per run (one issuance, one
renewal from the stored CSR).

What it proves that nothing else can:

* certbot's ``--csr`` mode really is driven correctly by the built command —
  the golden master says what the argv looks like, not that a CA accepts it;
* the issued certificate covers the names in the CSR, which is the claim the
  whole feature rests on;
* **no privkey.pem is written**, which is the point;
* the certificate reports ``private_key_state: external`` and does NOT ask to
  be renewed — the #608 collision, checked against a real certificate rather
  than a constructed one;
* renewal re-issues from the stored CSR and produces a certificate for the same
  names, without ever having a key.
