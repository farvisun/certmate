"""A client needs a version that moves when the interface does, and not before.

The only version a caller could read was the release number — in the Swagger
document and in `/health`. It moves on every patch whether or not anything a
caller depends on moved with it, so it cannot answer *"will my client still
work"*. A client that pinned it would refuse a patch that changed nothing; one
that ignored it had nothing else to read.

`API_CONTRACT_VERSION` is that other thing. It is sent on **every** response as
`X-CertMate-API-Version` — a header rather than only a field, so a client learns
it from any response including the error it is trying to understand, without a
second call — and reported by `/health` as `api_contract_version` for anything
that already polls there.

The rule is written where the constant is: **minor** when the surface grows in
a way a caller can ignore, **major** when something a caller may depend on goes
away or changes meaning. Deprecating does neither — that is the point of
deprecating rather than removing.

Which is the second half. There was no deprecation mechanism at all: no
`Deprecation` header, no `Sunset`, no marker. So an endpoint could be removed
abruptly, with a 404 as the first notice, or kept forever because removing it
was the only alternative.

The mechanism shipped before it was needed, with `DEPRECATIONS` empty, because
the alternative is inventing it under time pressure in the release where
something has to go, which is the release where it gets skipped. It is not
empty any more: `/api/dns-providers/accounts`, a second public address for the
operation `/api/dns/accounts` already serves, is deprecated since 2026-09-18.
Most of these tests still drive an example entry rather than production data,
so the shape stays tested independently of what happens to be deprecated.
