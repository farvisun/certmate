"""Guards on the requirements files the Dockerfile advertises.

`requirements-minimal.txt` is not a convenience copy — the Dockerfile documents
`REQUIREMENTS_FILE` as a supported build argument, so it is a shipped product
surface. It had been missing SQLAlchemy for months: `modules/core/factory.py`
imports APScheduler's `SQLAlchemyJobStore` at module scope, so an image built
from it died during gunicorn's worker import and restart-looped forever (#514).

Nothing caught it because nothing built it. CI now builds *and boots* every
advertised variant; these tests are the cheap part of that guard — they run in
milliseconds and catch the two failure modes a Docker job is slow at proving:
a boot-critical distribution going missing, and the two files drifting apart on
a version pin.

    Until 2026-08-08 this was defended by accident: pip's own metadata refused

    pinned ACME stack. That guard rail is gone — `pip install certbot==2.10.0
    josepy==1.13.0 cryptography==50.0.0` now resolves cleanly and installs
    pyopenssl 26.4.0, which has dropped both `X509Req` and `X509Extension`.
    `certbot --version` then dies in `certbot/_internal/main.py` with an
    AttributeError, and every issuance with it.

    Nothing else here would notice. The unit suite mocks the shell, /health
    reports on the scheduler and the cert directory, and the image builds and
    boots perfectly well — the first certificate request is where it surfaces.
    So this asks the one question that matters about the pin: does the binary
    we shell out to still start?
