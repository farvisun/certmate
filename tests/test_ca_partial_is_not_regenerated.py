"""initialize() must not regenerate the CA when only one of ca.crt/ca.key is present.

The guard loaded the CA only when BOTH files existed; with exactly one present
(a masked restore that brought back ca.crt without ca.key, a failed extraction,
operator error) it fell through to _generate_ca(), which overwrites BOTH files
with a brand-new CA and no backup (the backup is gated on force). That silently
destroys either the ca.crt every deployed client trusts, or the only copy of the
signing key — after which no CRL can ever be signed for the old CA again.

initialize() now refuses on a partial CA and leaves the surviving file untouched.
