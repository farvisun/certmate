"""Any version a document tells you to install must be a version we ship.

`docs/installation.md` and its four translations published a hand-maintained
pin list under "DNS Plugin Version Conflicts" — the section you land on when an
install has already gone wrong. It said `certbot==4.1.1` while the project is
pinned to `2.10.0`, in all five languages, for long enough that nobody
remembered writing it. Following it gave you a stack CertMate has never been
tested against: the 5.x migration is still issue #103, a plan.

Correcting the numbers would not have been enough, and this is the part worth
remembering. The pins that make certbot start are `cryptography`, `pyopenssl` and
`josepy`, none of which the list mentioned. (`acme` is not pinned here at
all — it arrives as certbot's own dependency, which is why naming it in an
earlier draft of this docstring was wrong.) Adding them back one at
a time, in a clean virtualenv, `certbot --version` failed four times in a row:

    AttributeError: module 'OpenSSL.crypto' has no attribute 'X509Req'
    AttributeError: module 'josepy' has no attribute 'ComparableX509'
    ...

So the lists were replaced by `pip install -r <the file we ship>`, and this
test keeps any new list honest.

Scope: fenced code blocks only. Prose may name a wrong version — the sections
above now explain the drift by quoting `certbot==4.1.1`, and a check that could
not tell the difference would have to be silenced to let that stand.
