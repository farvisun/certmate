"""Can a backup actually bring this instance back?

Nobody had asked. There are tests for creating a backup, for listing them, for
masking secrets inside one, for the restore endpoint's authorization and for
its zip-bomb limits. There was no test that took a working instance, destroyed
it, restored it, and then tried to log in — so nothing noticed that the answer
was no.

Every AUTOMATIC backup is masked. `save_settings` calls
`create_unified_backup(settings, reason)` and `include_secrets` defaults to
False, which writes the mask sentinel in place of every credential. That
default is correct: a leaked backup must not also be a credential dump. What
was wrong is that every restore path treated those archives as authoritative:

  * `_try_restore_from_backup` installed the newest one as live settings when
    settings.json could not be parsed, producing an instance whose every
    password hash, bearer token, API key hash, OIDC client secret and DNS
    credential was the literal sentinel — and `setup_completed` was still True,
    so the setup wizard did not reopen. The operator was locked out, and the
    log said "Settings restored successfully from backup".
  * the pre-restore rollback archive was masked too, so the safety net under a
    manual restore could not recover a single credential.
  * and every successful login wrote one of these archives and then pruned to
    MAX_BACKUPS_PER_TYPE, so fifty logins evicted every older restore point.

Together: restore points created constantly by routine noise, evicting the real
ones, none of which could restore. This file is the round trip that makes that
combination impossible to reintroduce.
