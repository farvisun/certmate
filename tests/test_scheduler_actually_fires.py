"""The renewal schedule is verified by running it, not by reading its config.

Every existing check asserted the *configuration* of the renewal jobs — the
misfire grace, the coalesce flag, the jitter value. Nothing ever asked the
scheduler what it would actually do, and nothing ever let it fire. So the
product's core promise ("certificates renew on their own, overnight, at
randomised times") rested on settings nobody had exercised.

That gap has a concrete cost right now: CertMate was submitted to the Let's
Encrypt client list on the strength of meeting their randomised-renewal
criterion, and the jitter that claim depends on was asserted only as a number
in a config dict (#661).

These tests take the trigger the application actually builds, compute the fire
times it would produce, and separately let a scheduler run a job to completion.
