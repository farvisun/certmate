"""A CA refusal is a skip; a CertMate defect is a failure. Never the reverse.

The e2e suite treats a failed issuance as a failure of CertMate. Sometimes it
is not: Let's Encrypt staging answers "Service busy; retry later" and the job
fails for reasons entirely outside the code. Twice in one evening that turned a
green change red, and the reliable human response to a test that fails for
reasons unrelated to the change is to re-run it until it passes — which is
exactly how a genuine regression gets waved through.

So CA-side refusals became skips. That is only safe if the classification is
narrow: a filter that swallowed real defects would be far worse than the
flakiness it replaced, because it would convert failures into silence (#664).

These tests pin both directions.
