"""Cross-validate that every certificate-storage backend is wired across all
backend-set surfaces.

The DNS subsystem is guarded by test_provider_wiring_consistency.py +
test_frontend_provider_coverage.py. Storage had no equivalent: the
s3_compatible backend (#304) is wired by hand into ~6 independent backend-set
literals, and the next backend (or a typo dropping one from a list) could ship
a backend that is selectable in the UI but 400s on config/test/migrate, or is
dispatched but never offered — with no failing test. This ratchet pins them to
the canonical set (what StorageManager can actually dispatch).
