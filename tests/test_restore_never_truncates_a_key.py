"""A corrupt archive member must not destroy the live file it overwrites, and
a restore that loses even one member must not report success.

`restore_unified_backup` extracted each member with
``open(target_path, 'wb')`` in the same ``with`` as the zip member — so the
destination was truncated to zero *before* the first byte was read. A bad CRC
(bit rot, a partial object pulled back from an off-site copy) or an oversize
entry then hit ``except: ... continue``, leaving the pre-existing file at zero
bytes while the function returned True and the API answered
``200 "restored atomically successfully"``. The certificates/ branch, holding
every ``privkey.pem`` and the ACME account key, had no cleanup at all; the
data/ branch removed the half-written file but still returned success.

Both branches now stage into a sibling temp file and promote by atomic rename,
so the live file is untouched until a complete copy exists. Any member that
fails is recorded, and a non-empty failure list raises RestoreIncompleteError
rather than reporting a clean restore.
