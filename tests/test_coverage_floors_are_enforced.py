"""The per-module coverage floors, and the ways they could stop being a gate.

`scripts/check_coverage_floors.py` is the durable half of #662. The tests that
raised coverage are worth little on their own: coverage decays, and a single
project-wide `--cov-fail-under` cannot notice one module going dark — that is
precisely how `resources_ca.py` reached 11% while the project number stayed
green.

So the floors are the thing that has to keep working, and a checker has three
ways to stop checking while still exiting zero:

* a module drops below its floor and nothing says so;
* a module with a floor disappears from the report, taking its floor with it;
* a new module in the layer arrives with no floor at all.

Each is asserted here, because a gate that passes without gating is the
recurring shape of defect this project keeps finding — and this file's whole
job is to be the one that does not have it.
