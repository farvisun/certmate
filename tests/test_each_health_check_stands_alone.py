"""Each health check is a function now, so each one can be called.

`create_health_resources` was the most complex unit in the repository —
cyclomatic complexity 64, higher than the certificate renewal path it reports
on. The complexity was not one hard decision: it was twelve independent
try/except sections inlined into two request handlers, none of which could be
entered except through Flask.

The practical cost was that a branch was only reachable by building an app.
Exercising "the configured storage backend failed to initialise and CertMate
silently fell back to local disk" — which is the check that exists precisely
because it used to be invisible — meant standing up a whole application to get
at four lines.

Every check and every collector is now a module-level function taking a
context and returning data, and this file calls them directly. The severity
ordering, which used to live implicitly in four `if overall == 'healthy'`
guards, is now one `max` with a test on it.

The behaviour is unchanged. That was checked by running the old and the new
module against identical inputs and diffing the JSON — once with every
subsystem working and once with every optional subsystem raising — and the
payloads were identical in both.
