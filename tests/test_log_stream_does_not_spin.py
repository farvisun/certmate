"""The log stream must not burn a worker thread at 100% CPU forever.

Regression test for #418. `stream_logs` tailed the log with
``while True: f.readline()`` — no sleep, no exit condition. At EOF readline()
returns '' immediately, so the loop never yielded and never blocked: the
generator spun on the CPU indefinitely, and because nothing was ever written
to the socket a client disconnect was never detected. The Dockerfile runs one
worker with 8 threads, so opening the Logs page eight times wedged the
container.

The fix sleeps between empty reads, emits an SSE keepalive comment (writing it
is what makes a dead client raise and end the generator), and gives up after a
bounded idle period.
