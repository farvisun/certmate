"""The web backup and cache routes, which the gated suite never executed (#662).

Four handlers, 40% covered: every success path and every failure path went
unrun. They matter more than their size suggests — `/api/web/backups/create`
is the one place in the web UI that can be asked for a **plaintext** backup,
and its `include_secrets` flag decides whether the file it writes is a
credential dump.

The failure branches are here too, because all four swallow the exception and
answer a fixed message. That is a deliberate choice — the detail belongs in the
log, not in an HTTP body — but it means a broken manager and a working one
differ only in the status code, and nothing was checking that the status code
was right.

These probe `/api/web/...` only. The handlers used to be bound to the bare
`/api/cache/stats` and `/api/cache/clear` as well, and this file asserted both
— but in the real application those two paths are served by the flask-restx
CacheStats and CacheClear resources, registered first, so the bindings here
never ran. Asserting them proved the behaviour of code no request reached.
