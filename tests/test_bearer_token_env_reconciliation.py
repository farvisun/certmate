"""The env bearer token and the stored one must not disagree (#401).

Two pieces of code decided two different things about the same token.
`is_setup_mode()` asked whether the OPERATOR supplied one via
API_BEARER_TOKEN(_FILE); `authenticate_api_token()` checked the presented token
against the STORED hash. On a fresh install those agree, because the stored
value is seeded from the env one.

They diverge for an operator who ran once without a token — one was generated
and stored — then added or rotated API_BEARER_TOKEN and restarted. The
essential-keys merge never overwrites a token that is already there, so
enforcement saw the new token while authentication still checked the old one:
the first-run screen asked the operator to paste the token they had just
configured, and answered 401. The documented way out was a reset script.

Reconciliation makes the supplied token authoritative, which is how enforcement
already treats it. The tests that matter most here are the ones about what it
must NOT do: it must not act when the two already agree, must not store a
malformed token, and must not touch an instance where the operator supplied
nothing at all.
