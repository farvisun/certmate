"""Every endpoint the API reference documents must resolve against the route map.

`templates/help.html` got this check when `GET /{domain}/tls` turned out to be
a 404 advertised four times. The API reference — the document people integrate
against — did not, and it had drifted a different way.

`docs/api.md` declared `Base URL: http://localhost:8000/api`, then wrote
thirteen paths relative to that base (`POST /client-certs/create`) and eight
with the prefix already on them (`GET /api/settings/rate-limits`). Read against
its own stated base, the second set resolved to `/api/api/...`. Whichever
convention a reader picked, one set was wrong.

The four translations were worse: they had **lost the base-URL line entirely**
while keeping the thirteen relative paths, so those had nothing to resolve
against at all. The same blind spot as every other defect found in this sweep —
the English page carried the piece that made it work, and the translations did
not.

Every path is absolute now, and this asks the application whether each one
exists, which is the only thing that knows.
