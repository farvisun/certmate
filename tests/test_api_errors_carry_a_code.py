"""A client should be able to branch on a failure without matching English.

Machine-readable error codes existed for seven conditions and were absent from
161 error returns under `modules/api`, so for almost every failure the only
thing a caller could act on was the human message — which is not a contract:
it gets reworded, translated, or has a domain interpolated into it.

The plumbing was already there. `models.py` declares `code` on the error model,
and the comment beside it records that marshalling strips anything undeclared.
What was missing was the requirement.

**This is a ratchet, not a rule.** Filling in 161 codes in one change would
produce 161 identifiers chosen in a hurry, and a stable-looking identifier that
means nothing is worse than none — a client would branch on it. So each file
carries a ceiling, and the ceiling can only go down. Two files are at zero:
`resources_lifecycle.py` (create, renew, reissue, the async job endpoints) and
`resources_downloads.py`, which is what the SDK and the CLI actually call.

Adding an error return without a code fails the build in every file, because
every file's ceiling is the number it has today.
