"""
Regression test for the certificate-listing settings reuse.

`CertificateList.get` (GET /api/certificates) loads settings once near
the top of the handler, then iterates every known domain calling
`certificate_manager.get_certificate_info(domain)`. Before this fix the
per-domain call did not thread the already-loaded settings dict through,
so `get_certificate_info` re-derived settings for each domain. In a live
Flask request `SettingsManager.load_settings()` is already request-cached
on `flask.g`, so each per-domain reload was a flask.g lookup plus a full
deepcopy of the settings dict — not a disk read. Threading the loaded
dict through `settings=` skips that per-domain deepcopy entirely.

These manager-level tests use a MagicMock settings_manager (no flask.g),
so each un-threaded reload shows up as one extra load_settings call,
making the per-domain reuse directly observable as a call count. The
storage-backend cert-info cache behaviour (the part that actually
matters for Azure KV / AWS SM / Vault) is pinned separately in
tests/test_cert_info_cache_and_storage_summary.py.

This test pins, at the manager level (the listing handler simply loops
over `get_certificate_info`):
- a listing-style loop that threads the once-loaded settings re-derives
  settings exactly ONCE regardless of domain count
- the bounded behaviour does NOT scale with the number of domains
- the old behaviour (no settings=) would have scaled 1-per-domain, which
  this test would catch
