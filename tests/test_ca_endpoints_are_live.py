"""Every built-in CA must serve an ACME directory that exists.

`digicert` pointed at `https://acme.digicert.com/v2/DV`. That hostname does not
resolve — NXDOMAIN from Cloudflare's resolver, while `one.digicert.com`,
`www.digicert.com` and `docs.digicert.com` all answer, so it is the name that is
gone, not the network. It was CertCentral's legacy ACME service, which DigiCert
stopped supporting on **24 February 2026**. The entry, the settings UI's
pre-filled default, and the CA guide in five languages went on naming it for
months afterwards, while the README advertised DigiCert ACME as a supported CA
with EAB.

Nobody noticed because a CA endpoint is only exercised during a real issuance
against that CA, and CertMate's release gate issues against Let's Encrypt
staging. Four CAs (ZeroSSL, Google Trust Services, SSL.com, Actalis) were
probed at the same time and all four answered correctly — this was one entry
rotting, not a systemic problem, which is precisely why nothing surfaced it.

The reachability check needs the network and lives in CI, marked so the offline
suite skips it. What runs everywhere is the offline half: the shape of the URLs
and the fact that a dead one cannot come back unnoticed.
