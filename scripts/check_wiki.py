"""Check the GitHub wiki against the facts this repository holds.

The wiki is a separate git repository, so nothing in CI has ever looked at it.
It has now drifted three times, and each time in the same way: it keeps a
second copy of something the repo has since corrected, and nobody notices until
someone reads it. The last sweep found four claims that were already fixed in
`docs/` — Python 3.9, a DigiCert host that stopped resolving in February, an
endpoint that returns 404, and an environment variable read by nothing.

This reads the truth from the repository — `app.py`, the `Dockerfile`, the
requirements files — rather than from a list maintained here, so it cannot say
"correct" about a number that has moved on.

    scripts/check_wiki.py [path-to-wiki-clone]

Exits non-zero with one line per finding. Intended for the weekly CI job, and
for anyone about to edit the wiki.
