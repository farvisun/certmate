"""Ask the built image whether every provider it offers can actually issue.

The test suite validates the issuance path against mocks. Every test that
touches `check_certbot_plugin_installed` replaces it with a stub returning
True — nine files do — so the one guard standing between a configured provider
and certbot's "unrecognized arguments" is never exercised against reality.

That is how Infomaniak shipped: a strategy, a credentials writer, a factory
entry, a README row, and no plugin in any image ever published. Nothing was
wrong with the code. The plugin simply was not there, and nothing looked.

This looks, inside the artefact rather than in a developer's virtualenv, where
the answer is whatever happens to be installed locally. It needs no test
dependencies and no hand-maintained table of names: the environment says which
distribution provides which certbot plugin, and the requirements files say what
we meant to ship.

    python scripts/check_providers.py [requirements-file]

The argument names the requirements file this image was built from — what it
was meant to carry. It defaults to requirements.txt, which is what the
published image installs; pass requirements-minimal.txt when checking that
variant. Getting this wrong in either direction is the difference between a
missing plugin and an optional one, so it is an explicit input rather than a
guess.

Exits non-zero when a plugin we meant to ship is missing or misnamed. Prints —
without failing — the providers this variant does not carry, which is a
legitimate state for the optional ones.
