"""Every dependency advisory we are living with must be written down.

CertMate holds `cryptography` and `pyopenssl` behind their fixed versions on
purpose: every release that clears the advisories needs a pyOpenSSL that
breaks the pinned ACME stack, and `cryptography==50.0.0` installs cleanly and
then kills `certbot --version`. That decision is recorded in SECURITY.md under
"Known dependency constraint", and the Dependabot alert is dismissed as
`tolerable_risk` pointing at it. Two steps, and the pair is the whole record.

On 2026-08-21 the record had drifted. SECURITY.md documented one advisory,
GHSA-537c-gmf6-5ccf, which had been dismissed months earlier. Three more had
been published on 2026-08-03 against the same pin and were sitting open,
undocumented, unassessed and unmentioned — through a release. Nothing was
wrong with the reasoning in SECURITY.md; it had simply stopped being the
complete list, and nothing looked.

A test cannot see live alerts, so this is a scheduled job rather than a gate
on the merge. It asks the repository which advisories it is actually carrying
and fails when one of them is missing from the file that claims to enumerate
them.

    GITHUB_TOKEN=... python scripts/check_advisories.py [owner/repo]

The rule is deliberately asymmetric:

  * An alert that is OPEN, or dismissed as `tolerable_risk`, MUST appear in
    SECURITY.md. Both are decisions to keep running with a known flaw, and a
    decision nobody wrote down is indistinguishable from an oversight.
  * An advisory documented in SECURITY.md but no longer alerting is NOT a
    failure. That is the normal end state of a dismissal: GHSA-537c-gmf6-5ccf
    is dismissed and still documented, correctly — the history of why a pin
    exists outlives the alert.
  * Alerts dismissed as `fixed`, `inaccurate`, `not_used` or `no_bandwidth`
    are ignored: those are not "we are living with this".
