# F-7 (2026-05-12 API auth audit follow-up): per-IP alone fails open to

# a single account regardless of where they come from. The window is
# wider than the per-IP one because legitimate users may legitimately
# fat-finger several times in a row from different devices/networks.

# that ever attempted. A botnet rotating through millions of source IPs (or
# attacker-chosen usernames behind a proxy) records each key once as [ts] and
# never revisits it, so the bucket stays non-empty. The previous sweep only
# dropped ALREADY-empty buckets — but a bucket goes empty only when
# _trim_attempts runs on its key, which happens solely for the current
# request's key, so a rotated key was never reclaimed and the dict grew
# unbounded. The sweep below trims every bucket to its active window when the
# dict crosses the soft cap, then drops the ones left empty — bounding each
# dict to the keys active within the window rather than forever.

    revisited is dropped once that lone timestamp ages out of the window — the
    old empty-only sweep could never reach it, so the dict grew without bound
    under source-IP / username rotation. As a hard backstop against
    within-window flooding (every key fresh, so trimming keeps them all), if
    the dict still exceeds 2x cap it evicts the keys whose most recent attempt
    is oldest until it is back under cap. The O(n) pass is gated behind the cap
