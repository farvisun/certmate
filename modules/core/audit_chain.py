"""Tamper-evident hash chain for the audit log (Phase 2 of l0 #408).

A parallel, append-only ``certificate_audit.chain.jsonl`` records every audit
entry inside a SHA-256 hash chain so that deletion, modification, or reordering
by anyone who cannot recompute the whole chain is detectable and localizable.

Each chain line is the canonical JSON of::

    {"seq": <int>, "entry": <audit dict>, "prev_hash": <hex|"">, "hash": <hex>}

where ``hash = sha256(canon({"seq", "entry", "prev_hash"}))`` and ``prev_hash``
is the previous line's ``hash`` (the genesis line uses ``""``). ``seq`` is a
gap-free monotonic counter, so a missing ``seq`` proves a deletion and a
REPEATED ``seq`` proves a double write — two different faults, and the verifier
says which. A repeat is not tampering: it is what two processes appending to one
chain file produce, and the append path takes an advisory file lock to stop it.

Honest threat model: the chain proves these N entries are authentic and ordered.
It detects tampering by anyone WITHOUT the writer's running state, but it does
NOT bind the operator, who holds the file and can recompute the whole chain.
Constraining the operator requires external anchoring of signed checkpoints
(Phase 3), which this module deliberately does not implement.

Stdlib only (``json`` + ``hashlib``) so the verifier needs nothing else.
