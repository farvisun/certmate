"""Prune an archived prefix of the audit chain (#445, part of #437).

Retention on a tamper-evident record is a policy question, not a disk question.
You cannot make deletion impossible on a file the operator owns; what you can do
is make it **non-deniable**. So this is not a background handler that quietly
rolls files away. It is one explicit command, it refuses to run unless the
prefix it is about to delete has already been exported and independently
verified, and the deletion itself is written into the chain that continues.

The order is enforced, not merely documented:

1. ``GET /api/audit/export`` (or the same call in-process) produces a signed
   bundle of the prefix.
2. The operator verifies it **off the box**::

       python -m modules.core.audit_verify --bundle prefix.json --pubkey instance.pem

3. Only then::

       python -m modules.core.audit_prune --bundle prefix.json --data-dir data/audit --yes

   which re-verifies the bundle itself, checks that it describes exactly the
   prefix of *this* chain, appends an ``archive`` audit entry, rewrites the
   chain without the archived records, and writes the signed anchor that lets
   the remainder verify.

**Deliberately CLI-only.** There is no API endpoint for this and there should
not be one: an authenticated request that deletes audit history is precisely
what someone who has just compromised an administrator account wants, and an
operator who can legitimately prune already has shell access — they have to put
the archive somewhere off the box anyway.

**CertMate must be stopped.** A running instance holds the next seq and the head
hash in memory; appending underneath it would make its next write collide. The
command refuses if the chain changes while it works, but that is a backstop, not
a substitute.
