"""Ed25519 signing for the audit hash chain (Phase 3 of l0 #408).

Signed checkpoints and a signed export bundle let a third party verify, off the
box, that an exported audit chain was produced by THIS instance and was not
edited. The private key is persisted under the data tree
(``data/.audit_signing_key``), like the Flask secret key, and never leaves the
instance unless an operator points ``AUDIT_SIGNING_KEY_FILE`` at an off-box
location.

Honest threat model: a local signing key detects tampering by anyone WITHOUT the
key and ties an export to this instance's public key — but it does NOT bind the
operator, who holds the key and could re-sign a rewritten chain. Constraining the
operator needs external anchoring of signed checkpoints (a planned follow-up, not
implemented here).

Signing is best-effort: if the key cannot be loaded or generated, signing is
disabled and the unsigned hash chain (Phase 2) still works.

        where a missing key is not a first run — it is the wrong directory, or
        an unset ``AUDIT_SIGNING_KEY_FILE``, or a key that has been lost.
        ``audit_prune`` is the case: it had a check for `available` that could
        never fail, because the constructor it was checking had just created
        the key it was asking about. Minting there signs the new anchor with a
        key that is not the instance's, after deleting the records the anchor
