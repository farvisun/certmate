#
# A generic webhook used to be "POST this fixed JSON, optionally signed, with
# whatever headers you typed". Slack, PagerDuty, Mattermost, an internal ITSM
# endpoint — each wants its own body shape and its own way of being told who
# is calling. These fields make that declarative config rather than a shell
# hook with curl in it:
#
#   method           POST (default) | PUT | PATCH
#   auth_type        none (default) | bearer | basic | header
#   auth_token       bearer token, or the header value for auth_type=header
#   auth_username    basic auth
#   auth_password    basic auth
#   auth_header      header name for auth_type=header (default X-API-Key)
#   payload_template JSON text with {{placeholders}}; empty = the default body
#   timeout          seconds, 1..60 (default 10)
#   max_retries      total delivery attempts, 1..5 (default 3, as before); 0 is
#                    accepted from older configs and means 1
#
# Every secret-bearing field name matches the settings secret regex (token,
# password), so it is masked on GET and restored on a round-trip save.

# Events that are always delivered, whatever the operator's event filter, because
# they report a failure the operator must not be able to silence by accident.
# deploy_hook_failed is the one that motivated this: it is not among the events
# the UI offers, so any filter set there drops it — see notify(). Deliberately
# not among them: it is delivered whatever the filter says, and a checkbox
# would offer a choice that does not exist.
#
# certificate_deploy_incomplete is here for the same reason and answers a
# different question. deploy_hook_failed says which target broke, once per
# target; this says the thing the operator actually needs after a renewal —
# the certificate was obtained and the systems that serve it may still be
# presenting the previous one. An operator who silences it has chosen not to
# be told that a renewal did not reach production.

    Gotify the incoming-webhook URL embeds the bearer token in its path, so
    anyone who reads it can post to the channel. It is masked in
    `GET /api/web/settings` and kept out of the share-safe backup ZIP for
    exactly that reason.

    `_log_delivery` wrote it in full to `data/webhook_deliveries.jsonl`, and
    `get_deliveries` handed it straight back through
    `GET /api/webhooks/deliveries`. The same secret therefore sat in a second
    file on disk and left by a second route, while the first was carefully

    guard both log `urlparse(url).hostname` and nothing else; only this one
    call site did not. The origin is what an operator debugging a delivery
    needs — *which host did it go to* — and the record already carries
    `webhook_name`, `webhook_type` and `event` for identity.

    Userinfo goes with the rest: `https://u:p@host/x` keeps only
    `https://host`. Port is kept, because a delivery to :8443 rather than :443
