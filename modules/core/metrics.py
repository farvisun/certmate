# Application info.

# This used to be Info('certmate_build_info', ..., ['version',
# 'python_version']). An Info metric declared WITH labelnames is a family:
# calling .info() on the parent raises AttributeError on every version of
# prometheus_client (0.21 and the pinned 0.26 both), and the caller swallowed
# it and built this Gauge in the handler instead. So the Gauge was always the
# only metric that carried a value, while /metrics exported a permanently
# sample-less `certmate_build_info_info` HELP/TYPE stanza. The dashboard
# (monitoring/grafana-dashboard.json) and the docs already query
# certmate_version_info — the working one is now the only one.
