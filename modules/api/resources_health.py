"""Liveness, metrics and the diagnostics snapshot.

Extracted from the `create_api_resources` closure (#667). The managers these
resources used to capture now arrive as an explicit `ApiContext`, which is what
lets them be imported — and tested — without building the whole graph.

`create_health_resources` was then the single most complex unit in the
repository: cyclomatic complexity 64, higher than the certificate renewal path
it reports on. The complexity was not one hard decision, it was **twelve
independent try/except sections inlined into two request handlers**, each
contributing branches to a function nothing could enter except through Flask.

They are now one function per subsystem, at module level:

- a **check** answers "is this subsystem healthy" and returns a `Check` —
  a name, the string the API reports, and a severity. `HealthCheck.get` is a
  fixed loop over `HEALTH_CHECKS` that takes the worst severity. Adding a
  check is appending to a list, and the set of reportable states is
  enumerable rather than spread across an if-ladder.
- a **collector** contributes to the diagnostics payload and returns
  `(fields, errors)`. `DiagnosticsSnapshot.get` is a fixed loop over
  `DIAGNOSTIC_COLLECTORS` that merges both. A collector that raises anyway
  cannot take the snapshot down with it — the loop catches, records the
  section as failed, and goes on to the next, which is the property the
  twelve hand-written try/except blocks were each implementing separately.

Every one of these takes `ctx` and returns data, so a check can be tested by
calling it with a stub context. That was the practical cost of the old shape:
exercising the storage-fallback branch meant building an app.
