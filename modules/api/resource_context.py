"""The shared state and helpers the API resources need, made explicit.

`create_api_resources` is a single function holding 41 resource classes as
closures over ten managers and a handful of helpers. Nothing in it can be
imported on its own, which is why the HTTP layer is both the largest module in
the project and the least covered: reaching one route means constructing the
whole graph (#667).

This is the first step out of that: the state those classes capture becomes an
object that can be built and inspected, and the helpers that captured it become
functions that take it. Resource classes can then move into modules of their
own without each one dragging the closure along.

Nothing here changes behaviour. `build_context` reproduces exactly the lookups
and fallbacks the closure performed, including the `CertificateService`
fallback that lets tests pass a minimal manager dict.
